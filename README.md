# Installation
You need <a href="http://bower.io/">bower</a> to resolve the dependencies. In the project folder run:

``bower install``

If you have python 2.x installed, you can start serving the project via:

``python -m SimpleHTTPServer``

Else if you have python 3.x installed, you can start serving the project via:

``python -m http.server``

The server will than be reachable by default under localhost:8000

else use any other webserver to start serving the project directory or just open the index.html in your browser (which might result in errors dependendent on the browser)
